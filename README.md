# Text-summaruzation-with-TEXTRANK
Our project focuses on the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to the challenging task of text summarization. The goal is to develop efficient and effective methods for condensing textual content while retaining its key information.
TextRank for extractive summarization swiftly identifies and ranks key sentences based on importance, preserving the original wording while extracting essential information![image](https://github.com/Bochraboubou/Text-summaruzation-with-TEXTRANK/assets/72579521/25a5427c-8a34-486d-800f-3a0fd3e6c207)
